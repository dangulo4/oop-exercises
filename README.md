# Object Oriented Programming Exercises for Continuous Learning

## Exercises

* The following are exercise examples where I will be adding to learn and have a better understanding Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript:
  * Stopwatch object with three methods and four local variables. In addition, this exercise Adds a property to an object, or modifies attributes of an existing property.

## Exercises
* Stopwatch - Stopwatch object with three methods and four local variables
* Stopwatch2 - moving methods to the prototype for optimization technique. This leads to an issue where the property of the object is no longer is a valid state, instead abstraction should be used to hide the complexity and only allow the few members that will allow the clients of an object to work with it.
