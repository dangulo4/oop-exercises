# Object Oriented Programming Exercises for Continuous Learning

## Exercises

- The following are exercise examples where I will be adding to learn and have a better understanding Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript:
  - Stopwatch object with three methods and four local variables. In addition, this exercise Adds a property to an object, or modifies attributes of an existing property.

## Exercises

- Stopwatch - Stopwatch object with three methods and four local variables
- Stopwatch2 - moving methods to the prototype for optimization technique. This leads to an issue where the property of the object is no longer is a valid state, instead abstraction should be used to hide the complexity and only allow the few members that will allow the clients of an object to work with it.
- ProtoType Inheritance - Two objects, one is HtmlElement and the other is HtmlSelectedElment that represents a dropdown element. The exercise has prototypical inheritance from the parent HtmlElement to HtmlSelectElement. The parent element has one instance method "clicked" and one prototype element "focus". HtmlSelectElement that has an array with two methods, addItem and removeItem respectively. The HtmlSelectElement will inherit the click and focus from the parent HtmlElment.
- Poymorphisim - Exercise with the same methods but the render method acts different based on the HtmlElement calling it. The HtmlSelectElement will use a map method to list the elements in an array. In comparison the HtmlImageElement will render the src http address using the same parent HtmlElement.
